# DATA SCIENCE PHASE 1 PROJECT
## AIRCRAFT ANALYSIS
## AVIATION SAFETY INSIGHTS from U.S Aviation Accident Data

*INTRODUCTION*
This project provides analysis on the Aviation Accident data as provided by the U.S National Transportation Safety Board(NTSB). The project aims to give recommendation to a client seeking to expand into the aviation Industry with no knowledge of risks involved in aviation.

The project relies of data from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/drealbash/aviation-accident-from-1919-2023?select=aviation-accident-data-2023-05-16.csv) 

The project seeks to answer:
 1. Which aircrafts has the highest and lowest accidents,injuries and fatalities?

 2. Does number of engines in an aircraft impact accidents?

 3. Which aircrafts are best used for private and commercial flights?


 ## KEY STEPS IN DATA SCIENCE
 1. Data Collection from Kaggle.
 2. Data Cleaning: filter relevant columns & handling missing values.
 3. Exploratory Data Analysis: detective work that uncovers trends.
 4. Visualizations: create plots to explore key insights.
 5. Create interactive dashboard on Tableau.

 ## About the data
 * Timespan: the data spreads across from the year 1948 to the year 2022
 * Key columns used:

   *`Total fatal injuries`-to show extreme risks of the accidents
   *`Total Injuries`-to show impact of the  accidents
   *`Weather condition`-to show impact of environment on accident
   *`Event date`-useful for overal trends
   *`Aircrafttype`,`Make` &`model`-to identify the aircraft types
   *`Number of Engines`-to identify its impact on accidents


 * Visualizations:
 1. Aircraft Make with most injuries-

 2.Accident trends overtime by `make`- [image](Images/Aircraft&Injuries.png)

 3. fatalities across aircrafts- [image](Images/Aircraft&fatalities_trends.png)

 4. Number of Engines vs Accidents- [image](./Images/engines&Accidents_trends.png)

 5. Purpose of flight vs Aircraft- [image](./Images/Aircraft&Purpose_trends.png)

 *Aviation Accident dashboard
 Then I proceeded to make an interactive dashboard in tableau, to view: [AVIATION ACCIDENT DASHBOARD](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/sharon.kipruto/viz/AVIATIONACCIDENTDASHBOARD/AVIATIONACCIDENTDASHBOARD2#1)
